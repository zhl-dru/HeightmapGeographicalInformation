Grand Mountain Height Map

Height Map Resolution: (PNG, TIF and EXR) 4096 X 4096

Diffuse Map: (EXR and PNG) 4096 X 4096

Bump Map for Material: (PNG and TIF) 4096 X 4096

File Type: PNG, TIF and EXR

Notes:

There is a selection of file formats, and the diffuse map also comes as an EXR and is saved in a linear format, so may look washed out. Please increase the gamma to adjust the look.

The EXR and 4k resolution produce much higher detail and quality â€“ but you may wish to convert these to another file type to produce better performance if using in an animation or video game.
